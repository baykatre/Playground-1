# Playground-1

Playground 1 is my personal playing area by Java and Spring Boot. My main aim is improving my coding skills. Also remembering and updating my technical know-how. 

## Purpose
Specially, my main aim is creating a resource mine for future own projects. 
Modules in the app will be simple and has easy logic because the logic is not important in here.
Firstly, I want to use structures that not much used.

I hope I will be success.
